# BP3 Coding Exercise
Thank you for participating in the BP3 Coding Exercise. This is a small project captures the essence of the type of
work that we do here at BP3. The exercise should only take an hour or two to complete. 

## Project Layout
There are a couple of directories to note:
* `backend` is the Java version of the exercise
* `data` contains the JSON data files used in the exercise
* `docs` contains the `BP3 Coding Challenge.pdf` that details the instructions of the exercise
