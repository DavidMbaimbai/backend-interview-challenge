# BP3 Coding Exercise
Thank you for participating in the BP3 Coding Exercise. This is a small Java project that captures the essence of the 
type of work that we do here at BP3. The exercise should only take an hour or two to complete.  

## Exercise Instructions
For exercise instructions, please reference the `BP3 Coding Challenge.pdf` found in the `data` directory.

A successful implementation will be able to demonstrate the correct processing of each of the JSON files in the `data`
directory.

## Build

This project uses Gradle.  Run `gradle build` from the top level of the project to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.

##Test

Run `gradle test` from the top level of the project to run tests.
